# ANSWERS
## Question 1
- Python is a high level general purpose programming language. It is versertile and readable. It is interpreted language i.e it is directly executed by the by the interpreter.
### python key features that make it popular
- READABILITY - Python used a simple syntax that easy to read and understand even for beginners.
- VERSATILE - Python can be used in many places to perfom different tasks, i.e it can be used in web development, it can be used in data science and even in automationa and writing tests for programs.
- COMMUNITY SUPPORT - It has a large community of users who offer support through documentations
- Extensible - Python has a large number of modules which can be added to enhernce its code userbility and operation.
- OPEN SOURCE - it is open source allowing people to use it for free, and also allow other developers to contribute it thus enherncing its performance
### use cases
- DATA SCIENCE - Python has libraries such as pandas and matlibplot that are greatly used for data science.
- WEB DEVELOPMENT - Python has frameworks such as django and and flask which allow developers to create robust web applications.
- MACHINE LEARNING -  Python has libraries such as pyTorch which is used in machine learning
- AUTOMATION AND SCRIPTING - python is used in writting scrips and doing automations.
## Question 2

- then click get button, the python version you have selected will download and install itself on your machine. NB: MAKE SURE YOU ARE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET
### To verfit the installation
- open your command prompt and type in the following command
- python --version
- You may need to retart your PC if this command doesn't not work
## Question 3
- print("Hello, World!")
- A simple python code to print Hello, World! to the console.
- We us the print function that allow us to print on the console. Print is a python inbuilt function that allow user to display/output their data on the console
## Question 4
- DATA TYPE - this is the type of value that a variable can store
- VARIABLE - a container used to store a data value
  ### Numeric data type
- integer(int) -  this represent the positive or negative whole numbers, zero included
- floats(float) - these are real numbers with decimal points
- complex numbers -  these are number that appear in the a +bj where a and b are either integer or floats
### Boolean(bool) Data type
- Represents logical values ie true or false
### String(str) datatyoe
- This is made up letter numbers or special characters that are enclosed inside a double or a single or tripple quotes
### None data type
- Used to represent an empty container, it shows that a variable is yet to be asssigned a value.
### Scripts to show how data types are used
- Create variables of different data types
- integer_var = 10  # Integer
- float_var = 3.14  # Float
- complex_var = 1j  # Complex number
- string_var = "Hello, World!"  # String
- boolean_var = True  # Boolean
- none_var = None  # None

- # Print the data type of each variable
- print(type(integer_var))  # <class 'int'>
- print(type(float_var))  # <class 'float'>
- print(type(complex_var))  # <class 'complex'>
- print(type(string_var))  # <class 'str'>
- print(type(boolean_var))  # <class 'bool'>
- print(type(none_var))  # <class 'NoneType'>

- # Perform operations and print the results
- sum_result = integer_var + float_var  # Adding an integer and a float
- print("Sum:", sum_result)  # Sum: 13.14

- string_concatenation = string_var + " - Python Script"  # Concatenating strings
- print("Concatenated String:", string_concatenation)  # Concatenated String: Hello, World! -
